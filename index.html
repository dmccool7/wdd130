            <p>My name is Dallas McCool. I am originally from southern Idaho and now live in  northwest Arkansas. I have been married for 6 years to my wife, Mary. We have twin daughters that are three years old, and we are also expecting a boy any day now. I love to travel, my favorite place I have been is Japan. I think my favorite area to travel to is southeast Asia, as I also loved going to Thailand. Some of the places I haven't been to yet that are at the top of my list are: Egypt, Israel, UK, Greece, Cambodia, Vietnam, South Korea, and Italy. My favorite part of traveling is trying the different foods that are unique to the country or area. </p>

            <p>Arkansas sits on the edge of both the midwest states and the southern states, often being inculded in both of the categories. It contains the Ozark Mountains in the north and the capital is Little Rock. It is home to Hot Springs National Park, the only national park in the state.</p>
